			<p>This web application uses deep learning techniques to classify skin abnormalities into 7 distinct classes as discussed in detail below.</p>

			<p>The following descriptions were taken from this <a class="w3-text-blue" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.10417">research paper.</a></p>
			
			
			
<p>nv<br>
<span class="w3-text-teal">Melanocytic nevi are benign neoplasms of melanocytes and appear in a myriad of variants, which all are included in our series. The variants may differ significantly from a dermatoscopic point of view.</span></p>

<p>mel<br>
<span class="w3-text-teal">Melanoma is a malignant neoplasm derived from melanocytes that may appear in different variants. If excised in an early stage it can be cured by simple surgical excision. Melanomas can be invasive or non-invasive (in situ). We included all variants of melanoma including melanoma in situ, but did exclude non-pigmented, subungual, ocular or mucosal melanoma.</span></p>

<p>bkl<br>
<span class="w3-text-teal">"Benign keratosis" is a generic class that includes seborrheic ker- atoses ("senile wart"), solar lentigo - which can be regarded a flat variant of seborrheic keratosis - and lichen-planus like keratoses (LPLK), which corresponds to a seborrheic keratosis or a solar lentigo with inflammation and regression. The three subgroups may look different dermatoscop- ically, but we grouped them together because they are similar biologically and often reported under the same generic term histopathologically. From a dermatoscopic view, lichen planus-like keratoses are especially challeng- ing because they can show morphologic features mimicking melanoma and are often biopsied or excised for diagnostic reasons.</span></p>

<p>bcc<br>
<span class="w3-text-teal">Basal cell carcinoma is a common variant of epithelial skin cancer that rarely metastasizes but grows destructively if untreated. It appears in different morphologic variants (flat, nodular, pigmented, cystic, etc), which are all included in this set.</span></p>

<p>akiec<br>
<span class="w3-text-teal">Actinic Keratoses (Solar Keratoses) and intraepithelial Carcinoma (Bowen’s disease) are common non-invasive, variants of squamous cell car- cinoma that can be treated locally without surgery. Some authors regard them as precursors of squamous cell carcinomas and not as actual carci- nomas. There is, however, agreement that these lesions may progress to invasive squamous cell carcinoma - which is usually not pigmented. Both neoplasms commonly show surface scaling and commonly are devoid of pigment. Actinic keratoses are more common on the face and Bowen’s disease is more common on other body sites. Because both types are in- duced by UV-light the surrounding skin is usually typified by severe sun damaged except in cases of Bowen’s disease that are caused by human papilloma virus infection and not by UV. Pigmented variants exists for Bowen’s disease and for actinic keratoses. Both are included in this set.</span></p>

<p>vasc<br>
<span class="w3-text-teal">Vascular skin lesions in the dataset range from cherry angiomas to angiokeratomas and pyogenic granulomas. Hemorrhage is also included in this category.</span></p>

<p>df<br>
<span class="w3-text-teal">Dermatofibroma is a benign skin lesion regarded as either a benign proliferation or an inflammatory reaction to minimal trauma. It is brown often showing a central zone of fibrosis dermatoscopically [24].</span></p>

			</div>
			
			
			
			
			
			
			<p class='w3-text-black topp-margin'><b>What about patient data privacy?</b></p>
			
			<p>Your images are never sent to an external server. Any image you submit stays on your computer or mobile phone. This is because the model is running on your device. This is also why a batch of images can be analyzed in less than two seconds.</p>
			
			<p>The tech that makes this possible is called Tensorflow.js. It was created by Google.</p>
			
			
			
			
			
			
			<p class='w3-text-black topp-margin'><b>What do the decimal numbers mean?</b></p>
			
			<p>They are probability scores between 0 and 1. They show how confident the model is that a particular condition is present on the image. <br>
				For example, <i>mel, Melanoma: 0.231</i> means that the model is 23% sure that the lesion shown in the image is melanoma.</p>
